# The purpose of this work

Study in depth everything related with Robots, Inteligent Systems and Artificial Inteligent to try to create a robot witha lot of abilities.

In this project I will use only open source software and I will try to make this systems and this robot as cheap as I can, my big investment will be my time and all the money that I am investing to attend a data science program at U-TAD, a Artificial Intelligence Master at UPM (Universidad Politecnica de Madrid) and a Data Mining and Business Intelligence Master at UCM (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) and all others courses that I already did during my life. 

I will try to put everything in one place.

But first I will work in phases or blocks to make the project easy and in the end I hope to combine all the conponents in only one creation.
