# Artificial Intelligence

To create a Robot or a Intelligent System we need to study a lot of concepts of the Artificial Intelligence field.

The idea of this part is to resume some of the main concepts necessaries to create artificial brains, intelligent systems and robots.

Main Concepts:
* Artificial Intelligence
* Machine Learning
* Multi Agents Systems
* Positive and Negative Feedback
* Biological Algorithms
* Supervised and Unsupervised Algorithms
* Sensors
* NPL 
* Computer Vision


Let's talk more about each of this concepts.
