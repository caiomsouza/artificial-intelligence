# Labeled Faces in the Wild Home
Welcome to Labeled Faces in the Wild, a database of face photographs designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face recognition. The data set contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web. Each face has been labeled with the name of the person pictured. 1680 of the people pictured have two or more distinct photos in the data set. The only constraint on these faces is that they were detected by the Viola-Jones face detector. <BR>

# YouTube Faces DB
YouTube Faces Database, a database of face videos designed for studying the problem of unconstrained face recognition in videos.
The data set contains 3,425 videos of 1,595 different people. All the videos were downloaded from YouTube. An average of 2.15 videos are available for each subject. The shortest clip duration is 48 frames, the longest clip is 6,070 frames, and the average length of a video clip is 181.3 frames.

# Violent-Flows - Crowd Violence \ Non-violence Database and benchmark 
Violent-Flows - Crowd Violence \ Non-violence Database and benchmark: A database of real-world, video footage of crowd violence, along with standard benchmark protocols designed to test both violent/non-violent classification and violence outbreak detections. The data set contains 246 videos. All the videos were downloaded from YouTube. The shortest clip duration is 1.04 seconds, the longest clip is 6.52 seconds, and the average length of a video clip is 3.60 seconds. <BR>
